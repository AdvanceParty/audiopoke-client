# Whut?

Local websocket connection for Bose music service at our Cremorne office. If you want to connect to a different server, change the url constant near the top of the index.js file.

This is the most basic client in the world. Purely instended as a proof of concept to demo the content Soundtouch makes available via websocket connections. Further dev on the server component will seek to abstract the devices from the server, with the goal of a more flexible and generic system.

## Installation

- clone or download the source
- `npm i`
- `node index.js`

Or, you could just copy the content of index.js and use as a starter for whatever you want to do.

### Very Alpha, Much InProgress

The Server is running on a raspberry pi with the address ws://johhnyfive.local:3000 and under development.
**Expect breaking changes**
